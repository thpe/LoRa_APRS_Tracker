## Supported boards

You can use one of the Lora32 boards:

* TTGO T-Beam V0.7 (433MHz SX1278)
* TTGO T-Beam V1 (433MHz SX1278)

This boards cost around 30 Euros, they are very cheap but perfect for an LoRa iGate.
Keep in minde: you need a 433MHz version!

## Compiling and configuration

**There is a german [quick start](https://www.lora-aprs.info/docs/LoRa_APRS_iGate/quick-start-guide/) page! Take a look ;)**

**There is a french [quick start](http://www.f5kmy.fr/spip.php?article509) page! Take a look ;)**

### How to compile

The best success is to use PlatformIO (and it is the only platform where I can support you).

* Go to [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) download and install the IDE.
* If installed open the IDE, go to the left side and klick on 'extensions' then search for 'PatformIO' and install.
* When installed click 'the ant head' on the left and choose import the project on the right.
* Just open the folder and you can compile the Firmware.

### Configuration

* You can find all nessesary settings to change for your configuration in **data/tracker.json**.
* The `button_tx` setting enables manual triggering of the beacon using the middle button on the T-Beam.
* To upload it to your board you have to do this via **Upload File System image** in PlatformIO!
* To find the 'Upload File System image' click the PlatformIO symbol (the little alien) on the left side, choos your configuration, click on 'Platform' and search for 'Upload File System image'.

### Messages

This version is modified to send proper telemetry messages.
* PARM, for parameter descriptions,
* UNIT, for units,
* EQNS, for shifting the values a bit.
Currently, only voltage and current of the battery cell is implemented.
